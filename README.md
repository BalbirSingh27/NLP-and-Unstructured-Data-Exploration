# 🧠 NLP and Unstructured Data Analytics with Python

This repository showcases a series of Python-based projects focused on **analyzing unstructured text data**, including sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, and more. Each project reflects a distinct learning objective in the domain of Natural Language Processing (NLP), completed as part of the *Analytics on Unstructured Data* coursework.

## 📌 Project Overview

### 1. Text Preprocessing and Tokenization
- Cleaned raw text data through lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Tokenized text for further downstream tasks.
- Tools: NLTK, SpaCy, regex

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis on Textual Data
- Performed univariate and multivariate analysis on textual data.
- Visualized term frequency, word clouds, and n-grams.
- Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

### 3. Text Classification using Naive Bayes
- Implemented TF-IDF vectorization and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.
- Tools: Scikit-learn

### 4. Topic Modeling with LDA
- Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover hidden topics.
- Visualized topic distribution with pyLDAvis.
- Tools: Gensim, pyLDAvis

### 5. Word Embeddings and Similarity Analysis
- Generated Word2Vec embeddings and calculated cosine similarity.
- Analyzed semantic relationships between terms.
- Tools: Gensim, Scikit-learn

### 6. Sentiment Analysis on Product Reviews (AWS SageMaker)
- Built a binary classifier to predict customer sentiment from shopping reviews.
- Developed and deployed the model using AWS SageMaker.
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Boto3, AWS SageMaker

    "\n",
    "Zero-Shot Learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: 0.97\n",
    "Precision: 0.98\n",
    "Recall: 0.96\n",
    "F1 Score: 0.97\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation: Very high accuracy, but slightly lower recall suggests it may miss some positive or negative sentiments.\n",

    "Accuracy: 0.98\n",
    "Precision: 0.98\n",
    "Recall: 0.98\n",
    "F1 Score: 0.98\n",
    "Observation: The few-shot approach slightly outperformed zero-shot in all metrics, demonstrating the benefit of giving the model a few labeled examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cases Where LLM Predictions Differ from Actual Labels\n",
    "There were a few cases where the zero-shot model missed sentiments that the few-shot model correctly identified.\n",
    "For example, a review with subtle sarcasm or a mixed sentiment might have been misclassified by the zero-shot approach but correctly identified using few-shot learning, which had context from examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Potential Reasons for Misclassifications\n",
    "Lack of Context: Zero-shot models may struggle without specific examples.\n",
    "Ambiguous Reviews: Reviews that are neither entirely positive nor negative may lead to confusion.\n",
    "Prompt Limitations: The generic prompt for zero-shot learning might not have been nuanced enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Differences in Outputs from Various LLMs\n",
    "Claude (Summarization): The summaries generated were quite repetitive (\"Here's a summary of the review...\"). This suggests the prompt might need rephrasing or the model may need a more specific instruction.\n",
    "LLaMA (Likes/Dislikes): The output included formatting issues (<|end_header_id|>). This indicates the prompt formatting for LLaMA might need adjustment, especially the use of |start_header_id| and |end_header_id| tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Analysis**\n",
    "Few-shot learning provided a performance boost due to the availability of example-based learning.\n",
    "The prompt design for both LLMs needs improvement to avoid generic and placeholder responses.\n",
    "LLaMA's output formatting needs refinement to avoid displaying special tokens and to ensure it outputs clear and structured likes and dislikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations for Improvement**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Enhance Prompt Engineering: Provide more concrete and structured examples for the few-shot learning model.\n",
    "                                                                         \n",
    "- Refine Prompts for Claude and LLaMA: Avoid boilerplate language and use more natural, directive prompts.\n",
    "                                                                         \n",
    "- Pre-process Model Outputs: Strip out unwanted tokens (|start_header_id|, |end_header_id|) from LLaMA's output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Experiment with Temperature and Max Tokens: A lower temperature and properly set max_tokens could lead to more concise and relevant outputs.\n",
